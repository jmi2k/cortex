# Tutorial to start creating DSR configurations

This tutorial will guide you through the process of deploying and extending DSR configurations (DSRc). DSRc are sets of agents ( a kind of RoboComp component) that share a distributed graph data structure. See https://github.com/robocomp/dsr-graph for a detailed description and the theory behind DSR. To have a minimal set of agents acting as the running brain of a (simulated) robot we need four elements:

* A Robotics simulator such as CoppeliaSim, https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/ that provides us with a realistic physics-based world inhabited by a mobile robot.
* A bridge between Coppelia
